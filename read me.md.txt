Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

run_analysis.R works to merge the training and test sets to created one data set.

It then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

After appropriately naming the activities and labeling the data set, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
